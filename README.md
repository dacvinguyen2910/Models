# Machine Learning Models Repository

## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of various machine learning models for regression, classification, and clustering tasks. Machine learning is a powerful field that encompasses a wide range of algorithms designed for predictive modeling and data analysis. Here, we provide a brief overview of some of the prominent machine learning models included in this repository.

## Models

### Regression Models

1. **Linear Regression:** Linear regression is a simple yet effective model for predicting continuous values by fitting a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.

### Classification Models

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** KNN is a non-parametric algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors.

3. **Naive Bayes:** Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with a "naive" assumption of independence between features.

4. **Random Forest:** Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and reduce overfitting.

5. **Decision Tree:** Decision trees are versatile models used for both classification and regression tasks, offering interpretability and simplicity.

6. **Boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting):** Boosting methods create a strong classifier by combining the predictions of multiple weak classifiers, such as decision trees.

7. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** SVM is a powerful classification model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data into distinct classes. It can be applied to both linear and nonlinear problems.

### Clustering Models

8. **K-Means:** K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that partitions data into k clusters based on feature similarity.

9. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used for feature extraction and data compression. While not a clustering algorithm, it is a critical preprocessing step.
